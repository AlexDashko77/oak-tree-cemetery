# React App Setup Guide

## 📌 Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AlexDashko77/oak-tree-cemetery.git
   cd oak-tree-cemetry
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   _or using yarn:_
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

## 🔧 Running the Project

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   _or using yarn:_
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
   
   This will start the project in development mode. The app will be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

4. **Create a production build:**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   _or using yarn:_
   ```sh
   yarn build
   ```
   
   This command will generate an optimized production build inside the `dist` folder.

## ✅ Running Production Build

5. **Serve the built project:**
   ```sh
   npm run preview
   ```
   _or using yarn:_
   ```sh
   yarn preview
   ```
   
   This will start a local server for testing the production build.
